# Arid-Stream-Community-Resilience

#### Summary:
Spring 2017 surveys indicated compositional shifts in fish and invertebrate communities coincide with changes in precipitation regime. Precipitation was suspected to act as an abiotic filter via water quality and disturbance events in mesic and semi-arid streams. Here, compare community responses along a precipitation gradient to region-wide hydrological disturbance events in the form of floods and droughts. We collected 14 monthly samples of fish communities and local habitat following Hurricane Harvey to capture post-hurricane responses as well as responses to seasonal flood and drought events in 9 streams spanning a steep precipitation gradient. We also collected spring and fall samples in 2018 as well as quartely samples in 2020. Here, we analyze these data in conjunction with flow data from USGS gauges to investigate the role of precipitation, flow characteristics, and local habitat data to evaluate the following question. Does aridity act as an environmental filter to select for communities with adaptation to disturbance?
