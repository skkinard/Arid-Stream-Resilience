seasonality,-,"M/P: Seasonality is M/P, which is Colwell's measure of contingency (M) standardized by Colwell's within‐season predictability (P). This measures the degree to which the environment varies during the course of a single year. P represents the relative certainty of knowing a state at a given time, and is the sum of constancy and contingency. M describes how closely different states correspond to different time periods within a year. Thus, M contains information about the degree of seasonality experienced by an environment. P is maximized when the environmental phenomenon is constant throughout the year, if the seasonal fluctuation is consistent across all years, or a combination of both. "
